### Sorting

It's fun to see how sorting algorithms work, but in practice you'll almost never have to provide your own sorting routines. Swift's own `sort()` is more than up to the job. But if you're curious, read on...

Basic sorts:

- [Insertion Sort](Insertion%20Sort/)
- [Selection Sort](Selection%20Sort/)
- [Shell Sort](Shell%20Sort/)

Fast sorts:

- [Quicksort](Quicksort/)
- [Merge Sort](Merge%20Sort/)
- [Heap Sort](Heap%20Sort/)

Special-purpose sorts:

- [Counting Sort](Counting%20Sort/)
- [Radix Sort](Radix%20Sort/)
- [Topological Sort](Topological%20Sort/)

Bad sorting algorithms (don't use these!):

- [Bubble Sort](Bubble%20Sort/)
- [Slow Sort](Slow%20Sort/)
